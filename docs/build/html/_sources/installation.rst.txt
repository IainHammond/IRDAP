Installation
============

IRDAP is written for Python 3.6 and 3.7 and is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/irdap/>`_.
To install IRDAP simply type in a terminal:
::

   pip install irdap

Because IRDAP is being actively developed, it is recommended to regularly check for updates through:

::

   pip install --upgrade irdap
   
and install the latest version.

The most recent release of IRDAP is also available for download from its 
`Github repository <https://github.com/robvanholstein/IRDAP/releases/latest/>`_. 

Testing the installation
------------------------

In a terminal, try to access the basic help and the version of IRDAP:
::
 
   irdap --help
 
   irdap --version

If that works, IRDAP is most likely installed correctly. 

As a next step, it is recommended to run the :ref:`Example Reduction`.
