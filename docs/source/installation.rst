Installation
============

To use IRDAP, the user needs to have Python 3.6 or 3.7 installed. 

Installing IRDAP
----------------

IRDAP is available on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/irdap/>`_ and can be installed by simply typing in a terminal:
::

   pip install irdap

Because IRDAP is being actively developed, it is recommended to regularly check for updates through:

::

   pip install --upgrade irdap
   
and install the latest version.

The most recent release of IRDAP is also available for download from the 
`GithHub repository <https://github.com/robvanholstein/IRDAP/releases/latest/>`_. 

Testing the installation
------------------------

In a terminal, try to access the basic help and the version of IRDAP:
::
 
   irdap --help
 
   irdap --version

If that works, IRDAP is most likely installed correctly. 

As a next step, it is recommended to run the :ref:`Example reduction`.
